### Advent Of Code 2024 ###
## I decided to join Advent Of Code for the first time this year. 
## As I had school on the side it proved pretty challenging to have time every single day, especially as the problems got harder.
## So I managed to complete up to about Day 12 until deciding to stop and refocusing on learning in other ways.
## This year I focused on Typescript.
